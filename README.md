## Title: Identifying novel druggable inhibitors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: an in-silico approach

### Abstract:
This project addresses chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a progressive lung disease with a high incidence rate and a significant impact on mortality. This study focused on the identification, functional and interaction network, and functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes in COPD patients. Using the NCBI database, two gene expression datasets were retrieved from the GSE38974_GLP4133 and GSE106986 studies. The differentially expressed genes in both studies were analyzed and four common genes were obtained - PPP6R1, FGFBP1, CD86 and LRRC2. A functional analysis was also carried out with the aim of identifying genes with physical interactions, co-located or found in the same signaling pathway, resulting in three networks to which a functional enrichment analysis was applied. The FGFBP1 network proved to be mainly associated with the signaling pathway of fibroblast growth factors and their receptors; the CD86 network showed a strong relationship with inflammatory response mechanisms; and the PPP6R1 network highlighted its association with protein dephosphorylation. The LRRC2 gene had no network. These results allowed us to highlight three genes over-expressed in COPD patients, which may support further studies focusing on their potential as therapeutic targets.
